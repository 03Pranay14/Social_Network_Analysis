# Social_Network_Analysis
This project performs Social Network Analysis on movies adapted from books, examining character interactions, relationships, and narrative structures. By analyzing co-occurrence networks, centrality measures, and community detection, we uncover insights into how book-to-movie adaptations handle character dynamics.
